    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Company (3D Technologies) has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service\n",
    "equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach\n",
    "promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are\n",
    "performed only when warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the\n",
    "probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and\n",
    "false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for\n",
    "non-failure and 1 for failure.\n",

    "#### Plan for development\n",
    "1. Read the data\n",
    "2. Data exploration\n",
    "    * Calculate the distribution of total fail/not fail cases\n",
    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by year\n",
    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by month\n",
    "    * Are there any devices that have higher failure rates than others\n",
    "    * When a device fails, does it disappear from the data, or does it show up again\n",
    "    * Are there particular days of the week when a higher percent of devices fail?\n",
    "3. Understand the important variables for splitting the dataset\n",
    "    * Do a pre-modeling analysis using decision trees\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to understand which are the important drivers for the outcome\n",
    "4. Derive new features\n",
    "    * Determine which features are categorical, and if needed create dummies\n",
    "    * Since the data for some of the features is very sparse, create dummies which are 1, if data is available and 0 otherwise\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to decide how to split by categories of attributes\n",
    "    * Should I do PCA? (likely no..)\n",
    "5. Sampling of the data (70/30)\n",
    "    * Create random samples from the data - 70% for training and 30% for validation\n",
    "    * If the failures are too few compared to the non-failures, I will need to oversample the failures (and add a weight), or simply undersample the non-failures\n",
    "    * Dealing with imbalanced datasets (https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9488/xgboost-give-more-importance-to-recent-samples)\n",
    "6. Do we need separate models for different groups of devices?\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to figure this out\n",
    "        * Run decision trees on all devices\n",
    "        * Run decision trees by types of devices, determined by the first letter - S, W, or Z\n",
    "7. Variables reduction\n",
    "    * Use decision trees\n",
    "    * Use p-values\n",
    "    * LASSO\n",
    "    * Random forest's variable importance\n",
    "    * Stepwise logistic regression\n",
    "    * Compare the suggested features from each method\n",
    "8. Decide on a methodology for the model estimation\n",
    "    * Random forest\n",
    "    * Random forest with XG boosting\n",
    "    * Random forest with ADA\n",
    "    * SVM\n",
    "    * Penalized-SVM\n",
    "    * Neural network\n",
    "    * Logistic regression\n",
    "9. Validate the results\n",
    "10. Accuracy measures\n",
    "    * Calculate c-statistic and ROC\n",
    "    * Plot the performance for multiple modles using the area under the curve (AUC) graph\n",
    "    * Create a deciles table with lift, and graph it\n",
    "    * Sensitivity/Recall\n",
    "    * Specificity\n",
    "11. Create a confusion matrix - reduce false positives and false negatives\n",
    "12. Does the methodology we use allow us to understand what drives the outcome? If it doesn't, do we need another methodology that can help with that?\n"
