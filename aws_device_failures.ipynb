    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Company (3D Technologies) has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service\n",
    "equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach\n",
    "promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are\n",
    "performed only when warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the\n",
    "probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and\n",
    "false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for\n",
    "non-failure and 1 for failure.\n",

    "1. Read the data\n",
    "2. Data exploration\n",
    "    * Calculate the distribution of total fail/not fail cases\n",
    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by year\n",
    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by month\n",
    "    * Are there any devices that have higher failure rates than others\n",
    "    * When a device fails, does it disappear from the data, or does it show up again\n",
    "    * Are there particular days of the week when a higher percent of devices fail?\n",
    "3. Understand the important variables for splitting the dataset\n",
    "    * Do a pre-modeling analysis using decision trees\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to understand which are the important drivers for the outcome\n",
    "4. Derive new features\n",
    "    * Determine which features are categorical, and if needed create dummies\n",
    "    * Since the data for some of the features is very sparse, create dummies which are 1, if data is available and 0 otherwise\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to decide how to split by categories of attributes\n",
    "    * Should I do PCA? (likely no..)\n",
    "5. Sampling of the data (70/30)\n",
    "    * Create random samples from the data - 70% for training and 30% for validation\n",
    "    * If the failures are too few compared to the non-failures, I will need to oversample the failures (and add a weight), or simply undersample the non-failures\n",
    "    * Dealing with imbalanced datasets (https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9488/xgboost-give-more-importance-to-recent-samples)\n",
    "6. Do we need separate models for different groups of devices?\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to figure this out\n",
    "        * Run decision trees on all devices\n",
    "        * Run decision trees by types of devices, determined by the first letter - S, W, or Z\n",
    "7. Variables reduction\n",
    "    * Use decision trees\n",
    "    * Use p-values\n",
    "    * LASSO\n",
    "    * Random forest's variable importance\n",
    "    * Stepwise logistic regression\n",
    "    * Compare the suggested features from each method\n",
    "8. Decide on a methodology for the model estimation\n",
    "    * Random forest\n",
    "    * Random forest with XG boosting\n",
    "    * Random forest with ADA\n",

    "    * Specificity\n",
