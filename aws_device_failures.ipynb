    "#### Background\n",
    "Company (3D Technologies) has a fleet of devices transmitting daily aggregated telemetry\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service\n",
    "equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach\n",
    "promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are\n",
    "performed only when warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal:\n",
    "You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the\n",
    "probability of a device failure. When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and\n",
    "false negatives. The column you are trying to predict is called failure with binary value 0 for\n",
    "non-failure and 1 for failure.\n",

    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by year\n",
    "    * Distribution of fail/not-fail cases by month\n",
    "    * Are there any devices that have higher failure rates than others\n",
    "    * When a device fails, does it disappear from the data, or does it show up again\n",
    "    * Are there particular days of the week when a higher percent of devices fail?\n",

    "4. Derive new features\n",
    "    * Determine which features are categorical, and if needed create dummies\n",
    "    * Since the data for some of the features is very sparse, create dummies which are 1, if data is available and 0 otherwise\n",
    "    * Use decision trees to decide how to split by categories of attributes\n",
    "    * Should I do PCA? (likely no..)\n",
    "5. Sampling of the data (70/30)\n",
    "    * Create random samples from the data - 70% for training and 30% for validation\n",
    "    * If the failures are too few compared to the non-failures, I will need to oversample the failures (and add a weight), or simply undersample the non-failures\n",
    "    * Dealing with imbalanced datasets (https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9488/xgboost-give-more-importance-to-recent-samples)\n",
